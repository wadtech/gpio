# Raspberry Pi GPIO

I've been playing around with the raspberry pi GPIO a little using wiringPi (and therefore, C).

Here are some little programs that might be useful to somebody, but are mostly for me to have fun with.

Eventually I might add wiring diagrams but probably not.

## Projects

1. [blink](blink.c) - Blink an LED
1. [fizzbuzz](fizzbuzz.c) - The classic Fizzbuzz program, with console and LED output.
1. [therm](therm/) - A program to read and record data from a temperature sensor.
